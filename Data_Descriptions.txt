Descriptions of data objects contained in SFS_Datasets.RData


ER_Datasets - named list of dataframes; contains raw Ecological Register datasets listed in table 1 with abundances.  

ER_Datasets01 - named list of dataframe; contains raw Ecological Register dataset listed in table 1, converted to presence-absence.

msdsp - Named list of distance objects; contains SFS output for Ecological register datasets

msdfet - Named list of distance objects; contains FET output for Ecological register datasets

mspairs - Named list of dataframes; contains PAIRS output for Ecological register datasets

mssp - Named list of dataframes; contains SFS output for Ecological register datasets (equivalent of an edge list, can be used to make network using igraph package)

msfet - Named list of dataframes; contains FET output for Ecological register datasets (equivalent of an edge list, can be used to make network using igraph package)

** All pairwise weights are in standard score format.  Use pnorm() to convert to raw probabilities. Use qnorm() to convert back to standard scores.
